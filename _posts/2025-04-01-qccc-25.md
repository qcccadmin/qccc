## QCCC-25: The Fourth International Workshop on Quantum Classical Cooperative Computing

<div style="text-align:center;">

</div>

### **QCCC-25** will be co-located with [ISCA 2025](https://iscaconf.org/isca2025/) in Tokyo, Japan, <br>on **Saturday, June 21, 2025** (half-day).

## Overview

Over the past few years, quantum computing has experienced remarkable growth—from early demonstrations of quantum supremacy to breakthroughs in error suppression using advanced error correction techniques. While last year’s workshop focused on how classical computing can bolster NISQ-era quantum devices to overcome environmental noise and technological limitations, the landscape is rapidly evolving. Today’s research is shifting toward fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) systems capable of reliable, large-scale computation.

**QCCC-25** aims to push these boundaries further by exploring innovative designs for quantum-classical cooperative computing (QCCC) systems that span both the NISQ and FTQC eras. The workshop will emphasize architectural and system-level approaches where classical computing not only enhances performance and scalability but also mitigates challenges such as qubit decoherence, constrained interconnectivity, and the overhead of robust error correction. Additionally, demonstrable approaches on current quantum platforms (e.g., IBMQ, IonQ, Quantinuum, QuEra, etc.) will be welcomed.

By bridging past insights with new technological directions, QCCC-25 seeks to bring together researchers from academia, industry, and national laboratories to advance the next generation of hybrid quantum-classical computing systems.

#### Talk Title
Hybrid Approaches to Quantum Applications and Compilation

#### Talk Abstract
Practical quantum computation will require a hybrid approach that will require substantial classical computation at all levels of the software stack.  In fact, I would argue that even exponential amounts of classical computation should be invested as long as the quantum advantage is larger and the latency is tolerable.

I will highlight several key ongoing approaches which leverage high-performance classical computation. Physics-aware, cross-layer optimizations will continue to yield important efficiencies to allow applications to make the most of quantum resources. Software-directed noise-aware optimization and error correction, in particular, will be key to increasing gate depths and maintaining acceptable output fidelity. Pulse-level optimizations and specialized native gates will also be key enablers. Additionally, algorithms will need to be co-designed using hybrid strategies involving high-performance classical resources as well as quantum hardware serving as special-purpose accelerators. Together, these approaches will leverage recent progress in quantum hardware and accelerate our path to useful quantum applications.

#### Title

Migrating NISQ algorithms and techniques to early FTQC

#### Abstract

This talk will explore ideas aimed at bridging the gap between today’s Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era and the long-term goal of fully fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). I will begin by introducing EFT-VQA (ISCA 2025), which proposes strategies for transitioning variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) into the early fault-tolerant (EFT) regime by leveraging partial error correction. Next, I will present DS-ZNE (QCE 2023), which extends the widely used NISQ-era error mitigation technique of zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) into the fault-tolerant setting. Finally, I will highlight how additional techniques developed for NISQ VQAs may continue to play a role in the EFT regime.

#### Title

Navigating Circuit Compilation Problems for Practical Quantum Computing: Key Challenges and Optimization Opportunities

#### Abstract

As quantum computing advances, the need for efficient compilation strategies becomes increasingly critical. Quantum compilation bridges the gap between theoretical quantum concepts and practical quantum advantage. On one hand, quantum compilation makes the logical circuits hardware-compliant; On the other hand, it significantly boosts the performance, resource usage, and fidelity of large-scale quantum circuits beyond what manual tuning and optimization can achieve. In this talk, I will present three projects, as three examples to highlight key challenges and optimization opportunities for practical circuit compilation: quantum Fourier transformation (QFT), variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), and Fermion-Boson mixture simulation. Compilation of these three examples cover three fundamental abstraction layers: hardware mapping, circuit synthesis, and Hamiltonian decomposition. They also cover exciting, intriguing, and intellectually challenging problems in quantum compilation today. Our experiments demonstrate a significant improvement in circuit performance and fidelity achieved through carefully designed compiler strategies. Our findings also illuminate how compilation techniques at lower abstraction levels of the quantum software stack can inform and influence design choices at higher levels, including algorithm design and even quantum theory itself. This demonstrates the critical role of effective compilation in realizing the full potential of quantum computing systems.

#### Title

Breaking Through Hybrid Quantum Algorithm Execution Barriers

#### Abstract

From the NISQ era to early fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC), hybrid quantum algorithms, particularly variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), remain a promising approach for achieving quantum speedup in critical domains, including combinatorial optimization and quantum chemistry. However, the effective and efficient execution of these algorithms presents significant barriers that must be overcome to realize their potential.

Here we discuss two approaches to break through these execution barriers. First, RED-QAOA focuses on effective execution by reducing both quantum circuit depth and qubit requirements, making VQAs more resilient to noise in current quantum devices. Second, Qoncord addresses efficient distributed execution by optimizing VQA workloads across multiple quantum devices. Together, these contributions advance the practical implementation of hybrid quantum algorithms, bringing us closer to demonstrable quantum advantage in near-term applications.

#### Title
Two-Qubit Gates as an Architecture and Compiler Optimization Problem

#### Abstract
Many challenges in quantum hardware and compilation can be reframed as tractable classical optimization problems. This talk explores how tools such as linear programming, graph coloring, and numerical solvers can be applied to design-time trade-offs in quantum systems. We first introduce a frequency allocation framework for tunable-coupler superconducting architectures. By modeling both coherent spectator errors and incoherent decoherence penalties, we define a classical cost function that captures the fidelity landscape of multi-qubit modules. The resulting optimizer assigns qubit and coupler frequencies to maximize gate fidelity under tight spectral constraints. We then present a synthesis method for arbitrary two-qubit unitaries, formulated as a linear program over canonical gate invariants and followed by lightweight numerical optimization. This hybrid LP-numerical approach enables efficient decomposition across heterogeneous instruction sets and supports ISA-aware compilation. Together, these methods demonstrate how classical optimization can unify quantum architecture and compiler design into a hardware-aware co-design workflow.
