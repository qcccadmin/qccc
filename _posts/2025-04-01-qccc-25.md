## QCCC-25: The Fourth International Workshop on Quantum Classical Cooperative Computing

<div style="text-align:center;">

</div>

### **QCCC-25** will be co-located with [ISCA 2025](https://iscaconf.org/isca2025/) in Tokyo, Japan, <br>on **Saturday, June 21, 2025** (half-day).

## Overview

Over the past few years, quantum computing has experienced remarkable growth—from early demonstrations of quantum supremacy to breakthroughs in error suppression using advanced error correction techniques. While last year’s workshop focused on how classical computing can bolster NISQ-era quantum devices to overcome environmental noise and technological limitations, the landscape is rapidly evolving. Today’s research is shifting toward fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) systems capable of reliable, large-scale computation.

**QCCC-25** aims to push these boundaries further by exploring innovative designs for quantum-classical cooperative computing (QCCC) systems that span both the NISQ and FTQC eras. The workshop will emphasize architectural and system-level approaches where classical computing not only enhances performance and scalability but also mitigates challenges such as qubit decoherence, constrained interconnectivity, and the overhead of robust error correction. Additionally, demonstrable approaches on current quantum platforms (e.g., IBMQ, IonQ, Quantinuum, QuEra, etc.) will be welcomed.

By bridging past insights with new technological directions, QCCC-25 seeks to bring together researchers from academia, industry, and national laboratories to advance the next generation of hybrid quantum-classical computing systems.
