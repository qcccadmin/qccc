                              CALL FOR ABSTRACTS:
                          The Second International Workshop on
                     Quantum Classical Cooperative Computing (QCCC-23)
                           Jun 16, Orlando, FL, USA

                             Held in conjunction with
    The 32nd International Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing (HPDCâ€™23)                   

The past five years have seen tremendous development in quantum computing technology, with the recent demonstration of quantum supremacy being a major milestone. However, today's quantum devices in the noisy-intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era are still vulnerable to environmental noise, internal interference, manufacturing imperfection, and technology limitations. As a result, quantum algorithms that are more robust to noise or can be effectively decomposed into small pieces for incremental or parallel quantum execution become increasingly promising.

The purpose of this workshop is to explore innovative ways of quantum-classical cooperative computing (QCCC) that can enhance the effectiveness and scalability of quantum computing on NISQ platforms. The workshop will focus heavily on how classical computing can improve NISQ device execution efficiency, scalability, or compensate for noise impact or technology deficiency, with a particular emphasis on demonstrable approaches on existing NISQ platforms, such as IBM-Q, IonQ, and Rigetti.

We invite submissions on topics related to QCCC for NISQ platforms, including but not limited to:
- Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms and applications for NISQ platforms
- Quantum error correction and fault tolerance in the NISQ era
- Classical methods for mitigating noise and improving NISQ device performance
- Hardware and software co-design for NISQ devices
- Quantum-classical optimization techniques for NISQ platforms
- Benchmarking and performance evaluation of QCCC on NISQ devices
- Quantum runtime systems and schedulers
- Parallel quantum computing
- Quantum resources management

We welcome original research papers, work-in-progress reports, and position papers that address these and related topics. Submissions will be reviewed by a program committee consisting of experts in quantum computing and related fields.

Venue:
This workshop is part of the International Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing (HPDC 2023) scheduled from June 16 to June 23, 2023 at Orlando, Florida, USA.
